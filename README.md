# Avocado miRNA analysis
This project shall identify miRNA's in the Avocado genome in two phases;
(i) Genome-wide identification of miRNA genes in the draft Avocado genome using in silico approaches.
(ii) Sequencing of miRNA's durinng Avocado infection by the oomycete pathogen Phytopthora Cinnamomi. 
NOTE: We shall use a dataset from Vitis Vinifera as a sample dataset to do preliminary analysis.
